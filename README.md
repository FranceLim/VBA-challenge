# VBA-challenge
You are well on your way to becoming a programmer and Excel expert! In this homework assignment, you will use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.

## Instructions
Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
  - The ticker symbol
  - Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  - The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  - The total stock volume of the stock.
  - Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
  - Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

# Note
I received help from tutors and learning assistants for this assignment. I made the error of previously trying to upload the csv file in my submission and received an error because the file was over the size limit. Time was spent cleaning up the code because I thought that would reduce the size of the file. After cleaning and realizing that the file was too big, I noticed the instructions asking for just the VBA script. Lesson learned. Next time, read the all of the instructions before starting the assignment.
